1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:03,837
So you've got
your SRT file with your accurate captions.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,489
Awesome.
Now let's get that uploaded to YouTube.

3
00:00:06,489 --> 00:00:10,910
On your YouTube channel, on the left
hand side, click "Content,"

4
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:14,514
then scroll to the video
you want to upload the captions to

5
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:18,918
and click "Details."
So this little pencil icon.

6
00:00:20,336 --> 00:00:24,257
On the left hand
side, click "Subtitles." Now

7
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:27,260
these captions you're seeing are the auto
generated ones that YouTube made.

8
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:28,678
Those are no good.

9
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:31,231
"Add language." Choose your language.

10
00:00:32,215 --> 00:00:35,101
I'm a stickler for detail,
so I'll say "English (United States)."

11
00:00:36,152 --> 00:00:38,038
Under subtitles here...

12
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,723
click "Add."

13
00:00:41,324 --> 00:00:43,359
"Upload file."

14
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,446
"With timing" is very important.

15
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:49,182
So when it asks you to select
subtitle file type,

16
00:00:49,532 --> 00:00:51,851
"With timing." "Continue."

17
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,572
Go to wherever you have the SRT file

18
00:00:55,839 --> 00:00:57,507
and say Open.

19
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,193
And there it is.

20
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:02,412
It'll give you a preview window
here so you can get a...

21
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:05,482
Just to
make sure things are looking good here.

22
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,850
So let's hit play.

23
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,203
[Today we're taking a look at the

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,489
HPRC 6300 hard case.

25
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,773
I've been meaning to do this for a while.

26
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,358
I haven't gotten to it just yet.

27
00:01:15,358 --> 00:01:19,379
It is like magic because it's
got the SRT file, all the accurate

28
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:22,115
captions, it's got the timing,
so you don't have to worry about that.

29
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:23,950
So that's really it.

30
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,886
Now you go up to here, say "Publish."

31
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,221
And you're good to go.

32
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:31,040
You can go back to the video.

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,411
In the lower right
hand corner, the CC icon.

34
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,446
Click that.

35
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:38,148
There you go.

36
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:41,401
It is now live for the world
to see with accurate captions.

37
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:42,919
Hopefully that helped you guys.

38
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:44,003
Thanks so much for watching.

39
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:46,739
I'll see you next time.
